  aboutme1:
    "My name is Marney Mallory. I am a junior full-stack developer with a passion for clean code, creativity, problem solving and collaborating with others. I am a recent graduate from Epicodus; a 6 month long full-stack coding bootcamp. Working in this kind of environment has strengthened my ability to communicate concisely and work cooperatively as a team towards a common goal. As an Epicodus student I have experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, React, and .Net/.Net Core as well as Node.js, MySQL databases and Test Driven Development with Jest. Epicodus has provided me with a growth mindset and I am confident that I will be able to pick up new concepts quickly and efficiently. Currently, I am a Software Engineer Intern at Moica Inc., a Portland based start-up. My team has implemented component development using atomic file methodology in Storybook. We are currently responsible for manually testing Graphql queries with Mocha, Chai, and Jasmine and making regular pull requests from the main branch of the codebase. We are expected to adhere to best practices while working within specific time restraints, as our application is expected to launch within the next two months. ",
  aboutme2:
    "My job experience prior to programming involved a 5-year career as a dental lab technician fabricating both dentures and crowns. As a technician, I learned how to create quality work while adhering to strict deadlines, communicate effectively inter-departmentally as well as with outside accounts, use my artistic skills to create lifelike fabrications while paying extreme attention to detail, and use my analytic and improvisational skills to complete a “rush case” after a last-minute material malfunction. My years as a dental lab technician taught me the valuable skills of communication, adaptability and ingenuity that I implement daily as a programmer. I decided to make the transition from the dental field to computer programming because I love solving problems and wanted a job where I can continually learn and grow. My time as a developer has been one of the most rewarding and character-building experiences of my life.",
